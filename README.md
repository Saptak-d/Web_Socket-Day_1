Exactly âœ… You got the essence, let me refine your thought in simple steps so itâ€™s crystal clear:

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Start with a normal HTTP server

By default, Node.js can only handle requestâ€“response (client asks, server replies).

Example:

const http = require("http");
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end("Hello");
});

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Mount Express (optional, but very useful)

Express makes routing & middleware easier than writing raw if/else on req.url.

So instead of raw callbacks, we pass app into http.createServer(app).

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Attach Socket.IO to the HTTP server

Here comes the key point:

const { Server } = require("socket.io");
const io = new Server(server);


Now:

The same HTTP server can serve both:

Normal HTTP routes (through Express).

Real-time socket connections (through Socket.IO).

Socket.IO internally listens for upgrade requests (from /socket.io/).

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Why attach to the same server?

Because the browser already connects to your HTTP server (to load HTML, CSS, JS).

Instead of making a completely separate WebSocket server on another port,
you "plug" Socket.IO into the existing server.

This way:

Clients connect to http://localhost:3000 for normal routes.

And the same address handles WebSocket upgrades for real-time events.

âœ… So your final understanding is correct:

Create HTTP server â†’ mount Express to simplify routing.

Attach Socket.IO to that HTTP server.

Now every request coming to the server can either:

Be handled as HTTP (normal web routes).

Or be upgraded into a WebSocket (real-time).
